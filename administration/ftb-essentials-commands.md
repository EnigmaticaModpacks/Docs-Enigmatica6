# FTB Essentials: Commands

Convenience commands such as `/home`, `/back` and `/warp` are in the pack, but disabled by default.

## Steps to enable commands

* Go to the folder `world/serverconfig/ftbranks`
  * `saves/worldname/serverconfig/ftbranks` for singleplayer
* Open `ranks.json` with a text editor
* Change `false` to `true` for the commands you want to enable.

_Note: The commands were enabled by default up until modpack version 0.4.11_

## Change command cooldowns

* Go to the folder `world/serverconfig`
  * `saves/worldname/serverconfig` for singleplayer
* Open `ftbessentials-server.toml` with a text editor
* Change the cooldowns to the values you want.
