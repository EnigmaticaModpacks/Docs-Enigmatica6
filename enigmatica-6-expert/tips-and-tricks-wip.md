# Tips and Tricks (WIP)

## Early Game

* Exploring is lucrative, with very useful loot found in loot chests.
* Batch crafting is recommended when doing Explosion/Lightning Crafting

### Ars Nouveau

* If you find a Takeoff spell in a Loot Chest you are blessed with early flight.

### Storage

* Your first Storage System can be Pretty Pipes' Crafting Terminal. It reads the inventories of all the connected pipes and allows you to craft with them. Transfer speed will be slow so you can use a Pipe Pressurizer when you get power to make those items zoom through the pipes.

## Mid Game

* Craft a Morphing Tool! It comes with all the tools included.

### PNC

* To reach very high temperatures (like for the Thermo-pneumatic Processing Plant) an active Blaze Burner (Doesn't need to be Super Heated) will increase the temperature up to 1426ยบ, with that and the help of Vortex Tubes and Thermal Lagging high temperature crafts can be achieved slightly earlier.

### Storage

* Rftools' Storage Scanner or Occultism's Dimensional Storage Actuator can make great alternate storage options prior to Refined Storage.

## Late Game
